The Salute Report Android App allows for the creation of SALUTE reports.  It walk the user through the process of creating a SALUTE report, and then writes the report to a file.

The SALUTE reports are stored in individual files with the `.salutereport` file extension. The file 
contents are written in JSON which makes it easy for other systems to consume the reports. If Sync
Monkey is also installed on the phone, the SALUTE reports are sent over to Sync Monkey so they can be 
synced to the cloud.
